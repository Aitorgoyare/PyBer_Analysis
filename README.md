# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

Create a summary DataFrame of rideshare data by city type. Using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multi-line graph showing total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, a summary with the different data by city type and how those differences can be used by decision makers in PyBer.

## Summary

- Rural cities have the highest average fare per trip per driver.
- Urban cities have 4 times more drivers than suburban cities.
- Urban cities have the highest demand for transportation, while rural cities have the lowest.
- Suburban cities have 6 times more drivers than rural cities with almost 4.5 times more income.
- The last graph show a trend in which revenue per fare is greater by city type when there is a greater ratio of drivers per trip.

## Recommendations to the CEO

- Offer incentives to drivers in rural areas to increase the number of drivers in order to increase market share.
